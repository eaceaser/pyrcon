PyRCon
============

PyRCon is a Frostbite Engine 2 RCon proxy server that is intended to be a replacement for Procon.

Goals
-----

* Support Battlefield 3
* Provide an easy platform to write event-driven modules to add functionality to a BF3 Server.
* Be crossplatform.
* Be lightweight and easily configurable.

Requirements
------------
* Python 2.7
* gevent (http://www.gevent.org)
* PyYAML (http://pyyaml.org)

Installation
------------
Currently PyRCon is installed by installing its dependencies and cloning the git repository.

::

  pip install gevent
  pip install pyyaml
  git clone git://github.com/eaceaser/pyrcon.git

Configuration
-------------
A sample configuration file is included at ``config/sample.yml``. Edit the file to your heart's content.

Running the Server
------------------
Currently the server does not daemonize itself. That is coming soon.

::

  ./pyrcon.py -c path_to_config.yml

It is recommended to run with ``-vv`` for debug output.

Running the Client
------------------
Currently, PyRCon's client/server authentication model is very simple. Configure a password in your configuration file, and
then run:

::

  ./pyrconc.py -P PASSWORD

Client Example
--------------
An example of the client usage:

::

  PyRCon> help

  usage: maps
  usage: version: BF3 Server Version.
  usage: vars

The client has full readline support, including command history and tab completion.

General Roadmap
---------------
* Finish pyrconc client
* Finish documentation.
* Add unit testing.
* Remove the simple JSON protocol and replace it with a strutured protobuf-driven protocol.
* Start a separate web frontend project for PyRCon.
* Rewrite the authentication to support multi-user credentials.
* Add SSL cert based authentication.
